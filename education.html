            <h2>I am a Speaker and Workshop Facilitator for Topics in Data Science and User Experience Design.</h2>
            <p>I'm a firm believer that the best way to learn is by explaining concepts concisely to others and seeing the "aha!" moment light up my students' faces. 
              For these reasons I give back to my community by teaching others about technology.</p>

              <p>My love for teaching started during my time at the University of Florida, 
                where I facilitated weekly workshops for a membership of 30 on topics such as cybersecurity, 
                web development, user experience, blockchain, and data analytics. I targeted leading 
                technology and associated career opportunities, such as "Day in the Life of a Data 
                Analyst" to allow students to explore career paths while gaining technical 
                knowledge to showcase to recruiters.</p>

          <blockquote>
          <p>
            What I did not expect, however, was a difference in way of life, <br>
            from the laissez-faire times stores opened and closed to the <br>
            ambiguity in how assignments were communicated and accomplished. <br>
            <br>
            Throughout my past month exploring Ireland and adapting to their <br>
            work culture, I have gained the knowledge to recognize how different <br>
            groups try to understand each other, and how I can respond using <br>
            my cultural intelligence to break through the lens of a “single story” <br>
            and establish myself as a unique individual and valued coworker <br>
            in an interconnected world.
