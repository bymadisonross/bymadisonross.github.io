            <p>As a workshop facilitator for Girls Who Code, I facilitated Design Thinking 
              focused workshops on career opportunities in technology for 25 students by 
              exploring the user experience design, functionality, and project management 
              behind application development. I am an advocate for students' well-rounded development 
              in the studies of Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM). 
              See my <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Knu_BXv2uYm7m49wEv9X1UyXU3Yd8Lo6JYHrWI_GnKU/edit?usp=sharing">application development workshop for Girls Who Code</a>.</p>
            <p>My love for teaching started during my time at the University of Florida 
              where I was the Vice President of Technology and President of GatorTech. I 
              facilitated weekly workshops for a membership of 30 on topics such as cybersecurity, 
              web development, user experience, blockchain, and data analytics. I targeted leading 
              technology and associated career opportunities, such as "Day in the Life of a Data 
              Analyst" to allow students to explore potential career paths while gaining technical 
              knowledge to showcase to recruiters.</p>

            <h2>Developing Cultural Intelligence Abroad, my Reflections on Dublin, Ireland</h2>
          <p><img src="images/ireland.jpg"></p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>
            What I did not expect, however, was a difference in way of life, <br>
            from the laissez-faire times stores opened and closed to the <br>
            ambiguity in how assignments were communicated and accomplished. <br>
            <br>
            Throughout my past month exploring Ireland and adapting to their <br>
            work culture, I have gained the knowledge to recognize how different <br>
            groups try to understand each other, and how I can respond using <br>
            my cultural intelligence to break through the lens of a “single story” <br>
            and establish myself as a unique individual and valued coworker <br>
            in an interconnected world.
