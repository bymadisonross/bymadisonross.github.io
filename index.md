## Design Portfolio

### Prototyped user interfaces at the Georgia Institute of Technology's hackathon and received 2nd place in User Experience Design

```markdown
Hackathons are events where innovators such as programmers, designers, and project managers collaborate to prototype new ideas, applications, and unique solutions from scratch; demoing their work to a team of judges.
```

Developed and designed **the GreenThumb Initiative** in Adobe XD, an iOS prototype where users scan their house plant via augmented reality to view a brief plant history, optimal growth conditions, and measure plant health with bluetooth-connected sensors.
