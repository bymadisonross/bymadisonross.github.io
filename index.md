### Prototyped user interfaces at the Georgia Institute of Technology's hackathon and received 2nd place in User Experience Design

```markdown
Hackathons are events where innovators
such as programmers, designers, and project
managers collaborate to prototype new ideas,
applications, and unique solutions from scratch;
demoing their work to a team of judges.
```

Developed and designed _the Green Thumb Initiative_ in Adobe XD, an iOS prototype where users scan their house plant via augmented reality to view a brief plant history, optimal growth conditions, and measure plant health with bluetooth-connected sensors.
