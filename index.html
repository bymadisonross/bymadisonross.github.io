        <h2>Hi, I'm Madison! I'm currently a Technology Consultant at Protiviti, Speaker for Women Who Code's Data Science Track, and Co-Director of Protiviti's Global Diversity and Inclusion Book Club.</h2>

        <p>I'm responsible for helping businesses manage their technology more effectively and securely
           while taking a data-driven approach to solving their toughest challenges. My work is guided by a 
           strong belief in the power of experimentation and behavioral analysis to revolutionize strategic 
          initiatives.</p>
        <p>I'm passionate about streamlining processes utilizing advanced analytics and machine learning 
          techniques, discovering and reducing bias in algorithms, and humanizing technology for the 
          accessibility of society's most vulnerable.</p>
        <p>My mission is to cultivate an inclusive workplace culture
          by widening individual perspectives and establishing a support system
          to empower more minorities to pursue careers and leadership roles in technology.
