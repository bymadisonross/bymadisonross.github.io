        <h2>Hi, I'm Madison! I'm currently a Technology Consultant at Protiviti, Speaker for Women Who Code's Data Science Track, and Co-Director of Protiviti's Global Diversity and Inclusion Book Club.</h2>

        <p>I'm responsible for helping businesses manage their technology more effectively and securely
           while taking a data-driven approach to solving their toughest challenges. My work is guided by a 
           strong belief in the power of experimentation and behavioral analysis to revolutionize strategic 
          initiatives.</p>
        <p>I'm passionate about streamlining processes utilizing advanced analytics and machine learning 
          techniques, discovering and reducing bias in algorithms, and humanizing technology for the 
          accessibility of society's most vulnerable.</p>
        <p>My mission is to cultivate an inclusive workplace culture
          by widening individual perspectives and establishing a support system
          to empower more minorities to pursue careers and leadership roles in technology.

                            initiatives.</span> Her work on the D&I book club has been effective and embraced by our 
                            employees. She has made sure to think strategically about the overall program by 
                            structuring facilitators for each office, the resources that they need to be successful, 
                            and ongoing programming and microlessons during periods between books. Madison is <span class="mark">organized, thoughtful, 
                            and her technical expertise is greatly appreciated.</span> Recently Madison assisted with the 
                            D&I Digest, our company's global D&I newsletter and not only recommended using a new 
                            technology, but joined the committee and helped with the execution. This type of 
                            <span class="mark">innovated thinking is what makes Madison an asset</span> to not only the D&I team, but to 
                            Protiviti. I enjoy the time I get to spend with Madison as <span class="mark">she is creative, she is an 
                            exceptional executer and she exudes our value of inclusion in her interactions with 
                            others.</span> I feel blessed that I've had an opportunity to know her and look forward to 
                            working with her more in the future."</p>

                              the team. She ensured we were on the right track, and has since spearheaded a 
                              series of new projects, ranging from a Summer Series around Fighting for Equity in 
                              response to the racial tension throughout the United States to a Design Thinking 
                              Session in which facilitators of the Book Club could build off of feedback in their 
                              discussion groups to identify ways in which our firm can improve upon our existing 
                              D&I infrastructure.
