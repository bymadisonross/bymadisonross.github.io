           <h2>Data Science Experience</h2>
           <p>I have experience with data cleansing and analysis in Alteryx (Designer Core certified), 
            visualizing data in MS Power BI, building machine learning models in Python (Jupyter Notebooks), 
            and querying databases in SQL.</p>
           <h3>Southeast Lead for Protiviti's Advanced Analytics Training and Development Program.</h3>
           <p>Protiviti's Advanced Analytics Development Team is a collaborative effort across a core team of developers, data administrators, and analysts to utilize low-code/no-code advanced analytics and machine learning techniques for the increased efficiency of clients and internal auditors.</p>
          <p><img src="images/alteryx1.png"></p>
           <p>I developed workflows displaying use cases of data analytics and machine learning via Alteryx and Power BI, automating standard Payment, Payroll, General Ledger, and ITGCs to increase efficiency of existing business processes by over 200% (projected). Created text mining and optical character recognition (OCR) workflows in Alteryx to process unstandardized invoice data.</p>
           <p>As part of this program, I spearheaded an Advanced Analytics training program for consultants in the Southeast region using prescriptive/predictive analytics, increasing efficiency in data visualization via PowerBI, data analysis via Alteryx, and ethical artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

          <p>I'm responsible for helping businesses manage their technology more effectively and securely
            while taking a data-driven approach to solving their toughest challenges. I've implemented data protection programs through performing descriptive analytics to evaluate scan results, removable media use, and externally shared files. I utilized this data to create data models and dashboards displaying key findings surrounding sensitive data in the environment. 
          </p>
          <p>Through interviewing Data Owners, I helped configure Azure Information Protection (AIP) sensitivity labels around existing business processes to classify and manage the organization’s sensitive data and mitigate risk from disruptive financial, operational, and security-related events. As part of the ongoing monitoring efforts of Azure Information Protection, I implemented a PowerBI dashboard to measure and report AIP health metrics in real-time.</p>

           <h2>User Experience Design Portfolio</h2>
           <p>I have experience planning Design Thinking sessions via LUMA recipes and MURAL boards, 
            and prototyping user interfaces using HTML/CSS and Adobe Suite.</p>
           <h3>I prototyped user interfaces at the Georgia Institute of Technology's hackathon and received 2nd place in User Experience Design.</h3>
           <blockquote>
             <p>Hackathons are events where innovators such as <br>
            programmers, designers, and project managers collaborate <br>
            to prototype new ideas, applications, and unique solutions <br>
            from scratch; demoing their work to a team of judges.</p></blockquote>
            <p><img src="images/HackGT.jpg"></p>
            <p>Developed and designed <strong>the Green Thumb Initiative</strong> in Adobe XD, an iOS prototype where users scan their house plant via augmented reality to view a brief plant history, optimal growth conditions, and measure plant health with bluetooth-connected sensors.

            <h3>Lead User Experience Designer for PorchLights</h3>
            <p>
              Neighborhood projects don’t need to be hard. PorchLights is a startup that shines a light for residents on the process of effectively building local neighborhood improvements.</p>
            <p>Lead User Experience Designer collaborating directly with the CEO/Founder to develop user personas, information architecture, wireframes, web app user interfaces, color scheme, logo creation, and design assistance in Figma for a whimsical and sleek end-to-end user experience.
            </p>
            <h3>I am a Design Thinking Advocate.</h3>
            <p>
              I have facilitated 30+ hours of Design Thinking Learning Lab sessions, a virtual 
              learning experience training up to 100 individuals per session on Design Thinking 
              basics. I coach small groups to foster skill development in remote Design Thinking 
              through activities and storytelling.
            </p>
              <p>I captured insights from 300+ participants via two design thinking sessions 
                to drive global D&I strategy. Utilized LUMA recipes and MURAL boards to complete 
                design thinking activities and address the prompt, "How might we establish Protiviti as a D&I Thought Leader?"</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  Pain points are specific problems that your people are experiencing <br>
                  as it relates to your prompt. These are challenges that, if solved,<br>
                  will provide the most value to your organization.<br>
                  <br>
                  Utilize feedback and identify recurring themes to uncover pain points <br>
                  and potential root causes. Do not be afraid to spend more time than <br>
                  you had planned on this step. This is a key insight that will be essential <br>
                  to the remainder of the Design Thinking session!
