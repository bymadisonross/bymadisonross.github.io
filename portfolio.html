        <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>I'm responsible for helping businesses manage their technology more effectively and securely
          while taking a data-driven approach to solving their toughest challenges. My work is guided by a 
          strong belief in the power of experimentation and behavioral analysis to revolutionize strategic 
         initiatives.</p>
       <p>I'm passionate about streamlining processes utilizing advanced analytics and machine learning 
         techniques, discovering and reducing bias in algorithms, and humanizing technology for the 
         accessibility of society's most vulnerable.</p>

            <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
           <p>I have experience with data cleansing and analysis in Alteryx (Designer Core certified), visualizing data in MS Power BI, building machine learning models in Python (Jupyter Notebooks), querying databases in SQL, planning Design Thinking sessions via LUMA recipes and MURAL boards, and prototyping user interfaces using HTML/CSS and Adobe Suite.</p>
           
           <h2>Advanced Analytics</h2>
           
           <h3>Core Development Team in Advanced Analytics for Next-Gen Internal Audit</h3>
           <p>Protiviti's Advanced Analytics Development Team is a collaborative effort across a core team of developers, data administrators, and analysts to utilize low-code/no-code advanced analytics and machine learning techniques for the increased efficiency of clients and internal auditors.</p>
          <p><img src="images/alteryx1.png"></p>
           <p>I developed workflows displaying use cases of advanced analytics and machine learning techniques in Internal Audit (IA) via Alteryx, Power BI, and Power Automate for the deployment of a global IA Data Analytics training program.</p>
          <p><img src="images/alteryx2.png"></p>
          <p>I automated standard Payment, Payroll, General Ledger, and ITGC Controls utilizing data from SQL Management Studio and Excel. Created and demoed text mining and optical character recognition (OCR) workflows in Alteryx to process unstandardized invoice data.</p>            
           <p><img src="images/Ethical AI.png"></p>             
            <p>I presented workshops on <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ArW1P1rR7WWz0gzybgv-Yz3Lb4EA_eS0PW5xMBNOvbE/edit?usp=sharing">the role of audit in ethical artificial intelligence (AI)</a> to 50 colleagues. Additionally, assisted in the development of an audit methodology for ethical AI. </p>
            
            <h3>Police Data Accessibility Project, Gathering Data to Empower the Public</h3>
            <p>I performed web scraping and data cleansing in Python on state and local government data sources for aggregation and consolidation to provide the public and policymakers with a digestible record of law enforcement activity.</p>
            <p>My team specifically focused on acquiring, reconciling, and validating FBI summary data of police incidents, the National Incident Based Reporting System, with state record management systems on police activity.</p>

            <p>I implemented data protection programs based on current state analysis, using best practices in data governance. Analyzed scan results and created data models and dashboards displaying key findings surrounding sensitive data in the environment. Interviewed Data Owners and configured security tools around existing business processes to classify and manage the organizationâ€™s sensitive data and mitigate risk from disruptive financial, operational, and security-related events.</p>

           <h2>User Experience Design</h2>
           
           <h3>I prototyped user interfaces at the Georgia Institute of Technology's hackathon and received 2nd place in User Experience Design</h3>
           <blockquote>
             <p>Hackathons are events where innovators such as <br>
            programmers, designers, and project managers collaborate <br>
            to prototype new ideas, applications, and unique solutions <br>
            from scratch; demoing their work to a team of judges.</p></blockquote>
            <p><img src="images/HackGT.jpg"></p>
            <p>Developed and designed <strong>the Green Thumb Initiative</strong> in Adobe XD, an iOS prototype where users scan their house plant via augmented reality to view a brief plant history, optimal growth conditions, and measure plant health with bluetooth-connected sensors.</p>

            <h3>Design Thinking Advocate</h3>
              <p>I captured insights from 300+ participants via two design thinking sessions 
                to drive global D&I strategy. Utilized LUMA recipes and MURAL boards to complete 
                design thinking activities and address the prompt, "How might we establish Protiviti as a D&I Thought Leader?"</p>
              <p><img src="images/DT.png"></p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  Pain points are specific problems that your people are experiencing <br>
                  as it relates to your prompt. These are challenges that, if solved,<br>
                  will provide the most value to your organization.<br>
                  <br>
                  Utilize feedback and identify recurring themes to uncover pain points <br>
                  and potential root causes. Do not be afraid to spend more time than <br>
                  you had planned on this step. This is a key insight that will be essential <br>
                  to the remainder of the Design Thinking session!
