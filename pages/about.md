# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I'm either building things to help people or building up people to tackle new challenges. I am particularly interested in intertwining elements of data analytics and human-centered design to develop empathy, craft compelling visual stories, and humanize technology and processes to meet user needs and apply more effective problem-solving methods.

Whether I'm building data models and dashboards to unlock insights for her clients, streamlining processes utilizing machine learning techniques, driving global strategy for an equitable and inclusive workplace culture, or facilitating workshops to demystify emerging topics like algorithmic bias and design thinking, I'm always looking for a new adventure. If you'd like to join one of my projects, or if you have something that might capture my interest, let's connect!
