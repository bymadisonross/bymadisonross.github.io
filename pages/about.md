# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I'm either building things to help people or building up people to tackle new challenges. I believe in the power of everyday moments and am particularly interested in intertwining elements of data science and design thinking to develop empathy, craft compelling stories, and apply more effective problem-solving methods.

Whether I'm building data models and dashboards to unlock insights for my clients, streamlining processes utilizing machine learning techniques, cultivating an equitable and inclusive workplace culture for minorities in technology, or facilitating workshops to demystify topics like algorithmic bias and human-centered design, I'm always looking for a new adventure.

If you'd like to join one of my projects, or if you have something that might capture my interest, let's connect!
