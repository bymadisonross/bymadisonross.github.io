<blockquote>
    <p>The Warrington College of Business at the University of Florida provides <br>
        a platform for students to develop personally and professionally through <br>
        engagement in student-run organizations and by utilizing Warringtonâ€™s <br>
        network of students, alumni, and staff. Warrington has propelled me <br>
        forward in my college career by providing mentors that challenge me to <br>
        create an impactful and lasting legacy.<br>
        <br>
        Their investment has inspired me to explore my passions, establish <br>
        relationships with staff and fellow students, and give back to the <br>
        community. My most significant and lasting contributions are identifying <br>
        opportunities for students to explore technology-focused careers in <br>
        Warrington and gain relevant experience to excel in their career trajectory.</p>

<p> My success is deeply rooted in my faith, driving me to seek out opportunities to 
    develop strong technical, interpersonal, and leadership skills while investing in others.
