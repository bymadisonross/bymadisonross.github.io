# Designing the Green Thumb Initative Rapid Prototype at HackGT
Hackathons are events where innovators such as programmers, designers, and project managers collaborate to prototype new ideas, applications, and unique solutions from scratch; demoing their work to a team of judges. Placed second in User Experience at the Georgia Institute of Technology hackathon (HackGT) for the development of an iOS application prototype, the GreenThumb Initiative. The Green Thumb Initiative is designed to help plant enthusiasts learn about their leafy friends and develop a green thumb. View my submission for HackGT on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/green-thumb-initiative-h0aeo4).

## Inspiration
I love house plants but find it difficult to remember how to best care for them. I wanted to build an app that will remind me to properly take care of my plants based on their preferences.

## What it does
Users scan their house plant via augmented reality to view a brief plant history, optimal growth conditions, and measure plant health with bluetooth-connected sensors. The scanned plant would be matched based on the USA agricultural public database, which has over 5,000 photos. The application can also be paired with sensors that provide real-time feedback on current plant conditions and if they're optimal for the plant.

## How I built it
I utilized Adobe XD CC to design the application and Adobe Illustrator to create illustrations of plants. View my rapid prototype designs in [Adobe](https://adobe.ly/2P6T1Hl).

## What I learned
I learned how to create a calming and minimal user interface while adding whimsical elements that gave the application character.

## What's next for Green Thumb Initiative
In terms of design, I would  more illustrations and options including a "My Plants" section to view all your plants at once. After building the initial design prototype, the next steps for this application would be to build the front-end and back-end technologies, with AR and database functionality.
