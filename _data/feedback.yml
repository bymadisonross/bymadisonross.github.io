She always is looking towards the future, identifying new opportunities to improve our firms Diversity & Inclusion efforts and taking the initiative to affect positive change. When Madison was asked to join as a Co-Director of the D&I Global Book Club, she did not waste any time to add value to the team. She ensured we were on the right track, and has since spearheaded a series of new projects, ranging from a Summer Series around Fighting for Equity in response to the racial tension throughout the United States to a Design Thinking Session in which facilitators of the Book Club could build off of feedback in their discussion groups to identify ways in which our firm can improve upon our existing D&I infrastructure. Any team would be incredibly lucky to have Madison join!"

She has made sure to think strategically about the overall program by structuring facilitators for each office, the resources that they need to be successful, and ongoing programming and microlessons during periods between books. Madison is organized, thoughtful, and her technical expertise is greatly appreciated. Recently Madison assisted with the D&I Digest, our company's global D&I newsletter and not only recommended using a new technology, but joined the committee and helped with the execution. This type of innovated thinking is what makes Madison an asset to not only the D&I team, but to Protiviti. I enjoy the time I get to spend with Madison as she is creative, she is an exceptional executer and she exudes our value of inclusion in her interactions with others. I feel blessed that I've had an opportunity to know her and look forward to  working with her more in the future."
