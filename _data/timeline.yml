  description: Protiviti's Advanced Analytics Development Team is a collaborative effort across a core team of developers, data administrators, and analysts to utilize low-code/no-code advanced analytics and machine learning techniques for the increased efficiency of clients and internal auditors.
               I developed workflows displaying use cases of data analytics and machine learning via Alteryx and Power BI, automating standard Payment, Payroll, General Ledger, and ITGCs to increase efficiency of existing business processes by over 200% (projected). Created text mining and optical character recognition (OCR) workflows in Alteryx to process unstandardized invoice data.
               As part of this program, I spearheaded an Advanced Analytics training program for consultants in the Southeast region using prescriptive/predictive analytics, increasing efficiency in data visualization via PowerBI, data analysis via Alteryx, and ethical artificial intelligence (AI).

- title: Technology Consultant in Data Security and Analytics, Protiviti
  from: 2019
  to: present
  description: I'm responsible for helping businesses manage their technology more effectively and securely
               while taking a data-driven approach to solving their toughest challenges. I've implemented data protection programs through performing descriptive analytics to evaluate scan results, removable media use, and externally shared files. I utilized this data to create data models and dashboards displaying key findings surrounding sensitive data in the environment. 
               Through interviewing Data Owners, I helped configure Azure Information Protection (AIP) sensitivity labels around existing business processes to classify and manage the organizationâ€™s sensitive data and mitigate risk from disruptive financial, operational, and security-related events. As part of the ongoing monitoring efforts of Azure Information Protection, I implemented a PowerBI dashboard to measure and report AIP health metrics in real-time.
