  description: I'm responsible for helping businesses manage their technology more effectively and securely
               while taking a data-driven approach to solving their toughest challenges. I've implemented data protection programs through performing descriptive analytics to evaluate scan results, removable media use, and externally shared files. I utilized this data to create data models and dashboards displaying key findings surrounding sensitive data in the environment. 
               Through interviewing Data Owners, I helped configure Azure Information Protection (AIP) sensitivity labels around existing business processes to classify and manage the organizationâ€™s sensitive data and mitigate risk from disruptive financial, operational, and security-related events. As part of the ongoing monitoring efforts of Azure Information Protection, I implemented a PowerBI dashboard to measure and report AIP health metrics in real-time.
